The project focuses on a Mixed Reality environment, blending virtual elements with haptic feedback. Its goal is to allow users to grasp and move objects in the virtual environment, using haptic feedback to render the sensation of different shapes and materials in their hands. In particular, a whole section of this project regards simulating the physics of soft, deformable objects and render the feeling of soft materials on the userâ€™s fingertips. The repository is organized in the following way:

- CoppeliaSim: contains code for simulation using CoppeliaSim. Integration between simulation and WeArt TouchDIVER.
- MuJoCo: contains code for simulation using MuJoCo. Integration between simulation, WeArt TouchDIVER and Oculus Rift S.
